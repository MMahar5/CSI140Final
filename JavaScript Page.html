          <h2>Challenges</h2>

          <p>-As far as setting up the html file that all went well. It was a bit hard getting the pictures to be the right size for each page and how and making sure some dont look funny while others look fine. It was a fun challenge though. I have played around with html since especially while
              working on this portfolio and have learned quite a bit in the last week on how to structure a page so that things are proportionate to each other without looking all funky.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>-The java script file for me started a little rough but that is simply because this is my first time using it. The hardest thing for me was passing information between multiple pages. I started with load session and sessionStorage then tried to do it with one script then mulitple scripts.
              I went down a rabbit hole where I'm not sure if I was even thinking straight anymore. The one thing I totally forgot to try was using post. My instructor did tell me about it but I haven't got a chance to try it yet with work being busy but that is what I plan to try next and will update my 
              progress.

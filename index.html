      <div class="topic">"The best way to create the future is to invent it" <br> </div>
      <p>My name is Matt Mahar. I'm 30 years old, born in Hawaii but currently live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. Some of my interests are building computers, designing and making projects on the CNC mill/3D printer, spending time with my dogs, gaming, hiking and of course coding. I am a CNC programmer by trade and have worked in machining for the last 12 years, with over 10 of those being with a company and the last 2 as a freelance programmer. 
        I took a leap of faith and decided to go back to school to learn what I should have a long time ago and that is computer science. For ahile now I have always been good at creating machining processes, designing cad models and making whatever I could think of. But there was still something missing and that was learning how to code with languages like Java, C# and Python. I've always wanted to bring my current skills and combine it with the programming
        I am learning now to truly innovate and invent the way I've always wanted. I believe there is so much that can be done through computer programming, solving the problems that haven't been solved yet, creating the things we think impossible. That is what makes this subject so enjoyable and why I aspire to be a future software engineer.</p>

       <div class="topic">"The best way to create the future is to invent it" - Alan Kay</div>
       <p>A few things I love to do are learn, create, innovate and optimize. In the world of today I think there is no better place to do that then within the technological world and more specifically coding. I really think programmers are and will continue to be the problem solvers and inventors of this day and age. As for myself, I know I am still fairly new at this and this portfolio will progress with the more I learn, but my goal is to continue my progress 
         in learning C#, HTML, Java and CSS. What I am most excited about is working with and learning from others on future projects and to see where the world of computer programming takes me.</p>
